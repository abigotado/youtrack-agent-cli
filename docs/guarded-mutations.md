# Guarded mutation contract

The CLI supports typed `issue.create`, `issue.update`, and `comment.add`
operations. It exposes no arbitrary REST method/path, deletion, administration,
attachment, bulk, or workflow-command escape hatch.

Current implementation state: offline `prepare`/`export` and local `status` are enabled.
`confirm`, `apply`, and `reconcile` fail closed with
`USER_PRESENCE_UNAVAILABLE` (or `RECONCILER_DISABLED` for an eligible future
record) until Gate 1A proves the separately signed native helper and the
selected executor passes its compatibility gate. There is no terminal,
environment, stdin, PTY, or `--yes` approval fallback.

## Lifecycle

Preparation/export/status are available now. The confirmation, dispatch and
reconciliation stages below describe the future gated implementation, not
additional commands or authority available in the current build.

1. Narrow read helpers capture the exact issue, project, field schema, immutable
   IDs, and expected-state hashes.
2. `mutation prepare --offline` validates the request and exact project
   allowlist using only non-secret local metadata and supplied snapshots. It
   allocates the plan ID before canonicalization and hashing.
   A failed `--out` export does not delete the authoritative journal record;
   `mutation export --plan-id ... --out ...` creates a new exclusive `0600`
   copy without network or credential access.
3. `mutation confirm` displays one immutable in-memory plan and mints a
   short-lived signed receipt only after trusted OS user presence. Piped stdin,
   environment variables, `--yes`, PTY input, and agent-controlled UI are not
   approval channels.

The native helper protocol has two distinct byte sequences. It displays the
exact bytes returned by `intent.ApprovalDisplayBytes`, stores their SHA-256 as
`receipt.plan_sha256`, then signs the exact unsigned-receipt JSON returned by
`approval.SigningBytes`. The implemented v3 field order and signed bindings are
defined by that [codec](../internal/approval/approval.go), including plan ID,
profile identity, key generation/fingerprint, challenge digest, registry revision,
and authorization-context digest. Cross-language golden vectors pin the encoding.
The [Gate 1A protocol](gate1a-protocol.md) records
the implemented pre-Gate v3 contract. Expected revision/context values are
comparison claims, not verified authority. A pure prepared-only journal v2
codec and internal pristine-v1-to-prepared-v2 storage migration exist, but
neither grants authority. Full authority-chain verification, durable
confirmation, and the native helper remain unimplemented; these codecs and
migration do not constitute a passed Gate 1A.
The activation boundary also requires the exact event-ledger codec in
[Gate 1A registry and ceremony protocol](gate1a-registry-protocol.md) and a
capability-specific, offline-root-signed provisional authorization plus
post-smoke production activation grant from
[Gate artifact authorization](gate1a-artifact-authorization.md).
Before provisional authorization exists, the same schema-3 receipt field is
exercised only inside an authenticated Gate session. Gate 1A uses canonical
`gate_receipt_context_v1`; Gate 1B uses
`gate1b_isolated_receipt_context_v1` from
[isolated subruns](gate1b-isolated-subruns.md), binding its exact root-signed
unit token, inventory, unit, host/target allocation, pass, architecture,
runner/session and prerequisites. Old single-suite Gate 1B context is rejected. This is controlled
Gate authority, not production activation; production, smoke, and post-grant
paths reject the Gate context type.
4. `mutation apply` validates the receipt signature, expiry, nonce, plan/payload
   and schema hashes, current identity, project policy, and preconditions. It
   additionally requires the signed registry revision, generation, exact SPKI,
   fingerprint, artifact descriptor, authorization-context digest, and
   authorized capability to equal the current active registry, the authority
   eligible for this closed mode, and running exact code identities through
   `confirmed -> in_flight`. Production/post-grant uses the exact signed
   provisional authorization, activation grant, and final context; Gate 1B
   uses the exact unexpired isolated-unit token, unit context, authenticated runner/session,
   and complete registry chain; activation smoke uses its existing signed
   provisional/smoke-token and smoke-context branch. The journal atomically
   persists the matching complete `authority_evidence` branch and its exact
   canonical bytes/digests with the receipt before this transition. Branches
   are mutually exclusive and cannot supply missing fields for one another.
   Before registry-ledger reads it enters its helper process's serialized
   executor, performs the registry protocol's bounded read-only coordinator
   integrity/capacity classification, rechecks expiry, and attempts acquisition
   only from clear below-capacity state. The fixed-active coordinator is also used by
   every enrollment/rotation/revocation/key-recovery commit. The executor guard
   orders only local callbacks. The fixed `SecItemAdd` primary key excludes
   independent same-UID helpers, including alternate bootstrap contexts;
   launchd registration is not a security singleton. While holding the
   coordinator, the helper revalidates the complete
   registry, the applicable context, and trusted current time strictly before the
   descriptor's `helper_profile_expires_at`. The exact canonical signed receipt
   digest is bound in the protected active, permit and normal-close records.
   Before permitting a request, the helper validates all retained permit/closed
   history and rejects reuse of an already consumed digest under any new lease,
   independently of the journal's contents or enumeration order. A normal
   pre-permit close burns the receipt even with no permit; an interrupted close
   leaves quarantine. Restoring a journal cannot restore approval authority.
   The journal CAS is crash bookkeeping, not the same-user anti-replay boundary.
   Only after the durable
   `confirmed -> in_flight` CAS may it create one permit bound to the exact
   request bytes. It holds the coordinator through that one send, durable
   outcome, and durable close; permit creation is the send linearization point
   and closed-record creation is the fencing/close linearization point.
   Retained public keys and historical authorization contexts verify audit and
   reconciliation evidence only. Any intervening registry or activation
   transition cancels confirmation rather than authorizing apply. Every crash
   without a valid durable close quarantines the lease, including before
   permit and after a durable journal outcome. A permit makes uncertain remote
   outcome ambiguous and never retryable. Receipt TTL, helper-profile expiry
   and applicable token expiry are independent cutoffs. Expiry observed before
   coordinator acquisition transitions `confirmed -> expired`; expiry after
   acquisition while no permit exists burns the receipt and closes
   `failed_before_mutation` with zero dispatch. The final pre-send fence
   repeats the profile-expiry, active-item, permit, connection, audit-token,
   session, journal-revision, registry, and context checks. An eligible plan
   sends at most one mutating request and performs bounded verification.
   Before normal close is added, the original uninterrupted owning connection
   irreversibly quiesces every send/sign/permit/commit capability, including
   queued callbacks and outstanding operations. Only this owner may persist
   the terminal journal outcome and exact normal close. No restarted or
   reconnected helper synthesizes close or CASes that journal. Gate 1B proves
   this with exact two-party barrier schedules covering
   rotate/revoke/recovery, invalid enrollment, every pre/post-permit crash,
   durable-outcome-before-close, close-add ambiguity, post-close crash, and
   active-delete ambiguity and an independent-process ABA schedule. Cleanup
   validates already durable active/permit/closed/outcome linkage, then deletes
   only the bounded opaque persistent reference obtained in the same exact
   read as A's attributes/value. If A is deleted and B acquired meanwhile,
   stale A deletion cannot remove B. No attributes-only fallback is permitted.
   At exhausted coordinator capacity the valid closed active remains as a
   durable sentinel: neither normal cleanup nor recovery may delete it. The
   admitted owner must finish its close before this capacity decision. See the
   registry protocol for the exact bounds and `capacity_exhausted` mapping.
   The future authority command contract assigns distinct exits 10..13 to
   wait for a local live owner, trusted already-closed cleanup, artifact
   replacement, and reconfirmation after an uninterrupted closed pre-permit
   abort. Quarantine and corruption use existing exit 1; the new authority surface never emits
   exit 9, while remote-uncertain reconciliation may retain it.
   None is retry permission.
5. `mutation reconcile` is read-only. Once a plan is `in_flight`, it validates
   the persisted historical receipt, exact authority sidecars, root signatures,
   descriptor/grant hash chain, context, and capability but does not require
   that authority to remain active. It may establish a unique applied result;
   otherwise it reports `operator_resolution_required`, unless bounded evidence
   definitively proves non-application. Zero or multiple plausible matches do
   not prove non-application and never justify an automatic new plan. While the coordinator
   is quarantined, even a unique remote match is a transient report only:
   no journal CAS, close add, active deletion, signing, permit, or replay is
   allowed. In the controlled Gate
   1B path, the equivalent validation uses the retained signed isolated-unit token,
   canonical Gate context, and complete registry chain under the still-
   authenticated matching Gate runner session. Token expiry after the recorded
   live boundary does not erase that historical chain, but it cannot authorize
   another confirmation, permit, or send. A separate reboot observer may only
   collect local quarantine evidence and export; it cannot reconcile remotely.

When execution is enabled, known application may become `reconciled`, definitive
non-application may become `resolved_not_applied`, and an explicit local
operator resolution may record `resolved_applied` or `resolved_not_applied`.
Inconclusive evidence stays `operator_resolution_required`; none of these
states revives a consumed receipt. In the future coordinator contract,
`failed_before_mutation` requires an uninterrupted owner's valid durable close
with no permit. After a durable permit, verified success is `applied`; every
other dispatch outcome is conservatively `ambiguous`, including a local
zero-byte pre-send denial or a rejection later used as non-application evidence.
This classifies approval consumption, not a claim that YouTrack applied a write.
Only subsequent bounded reconciliation of eligible closed state may establish
`resolved_not_applied`. No post-permit path returns exit 13 or reuses approval.
A crash without durable close cannot take any owner-only terminal transition.
Restart, reboot, expiry,
PID loss, and user presence cannot free an unclosed lease; it remains
`AUTHORITY_STATE_QUARANTINED` pending a separately reviewed recovery/reset
protocol. Read-only commands remain available.

## Future journal record v2 and migration

Journal v1 deliberately retains its legacy metadata contract: `ReceiptBinding`
requires only a non-whitespace key-generation label and has neither a registry
revision nor an authorization-context digest. That is not the schema-v3 approval
grammar, and a valid v1 metadata record does not establish valid v3 authority.
The production approver remains `approval.Unsupported`; confirmation does not
persist a v3 receipt into that record. Do not bridge the schemas by copying
metadata or treating the journal's validation as receipt verification. Full
authority verification and the strict v2 record/migration below must land first.

The Store still creates version 1 records, but only by a private frozen
prepared-v1 encoder that verifies the exact historical bytes and refuses a
live plan or record shape change it cannot represent. Its `Get` path strictly
reads canonical historical v1 and prepared-only v2, and its internal
`MigratePreparedV1` storage operation can replace one pristine prepared v1
record with a prepared v2 record. `CompareAndSwap` validates the named record
but refuses transitions for both versions until native authority verification
exists. This migration does not admit either version to a coordinator or enable
confirmation or dispatch. Native authority work must integrate the full strict
v2 lifecycle before any v1 or prepared-only v2 record can enter it.

The historical v1 wire is frozen independently of future `Record` and
`intent.Plan` fields, including the nested profile, policy, operation, request,
expected-state, visibility, and custom-field shapes. Its predecode cap is a
literal 1,048,576 bytes, not a future `intent.MaxCanonicalPlanBytes` value. It
is a JSON object encoded by Go `json.MarshalIndent` with empty prefix, two-space
indentation, no extra whitespace, and exactly one trailing LF byte. Its exact
top-level field order is `version`, `revision`, `state`, `plan`, optional
`receipt`, `mutation_attempts`, optional `outcome`, optional `evidence`,
`created_at`, `updated_at`. The optional fields use the historical `omitempty`
rules, including omission of empty evidence. Nested receipt, outcome, and
evidence retain their historical field order and omission rules. A decoder
must reject unknown fields, duplicate keys, reordered fields, alternate escaping/spacing,
additional trailing bytes, and any input that is not byte-identical to its
historical re-encoding; parser errors must not echo input. A semantically valid
v1 `prepared` record migrates only at revision 1, zero mutation attempts, no
receipt/outcome/evidence, and byte-identical creation/update timestamp
spellings. A valid v1 record in any other state or with later revision or
different timestamps is quarantined. A pristine prepared v1 record is also
quarantined if its historical timestamp or encoding cannot be represented by
the stricter v2 prepared codec. For example, a valid v1 time can use year
0000 or an offset that normalizes to UTC year 10000. An invalid v1 record is
malformed, not a migration or quarantine candidate. This
classification never establishes native authority.

A canonical v2 record contains these fields in order: `version`
exactly `2`, `revision`, `state`, `plan`, `receipt`, `authority_evidence`,
`coordinator_evidence`, `mutation_attempts`, `outcome`, `evidence`,
`legacy_v1_record_sha256`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`. Nullable fields are
present as literal `null` rather than omitted. The pure prepared-only codec
accepts at most 655,360 bytes before JSON decoding, the same
`json.MarshalIndent` two-space grammar and one LF as v1, and no trailing data
or noncanonical alternate bytes. It accepts `state: "prepared"` and
`mutation_attempts: 0` only, with `receipt`, `authority_evidence`,
`coordinator_evidence`, `outcome`, and `evidence` all null. A fresh v2 prepared
record has revision 1, null `legacy_v1_record_sha256`, and equal timestamps.
A migrated prepared record has revision 2, a non-null lowercase 64-character
hex SHA-256 of the exact historical v1 bytes, and `updated_at >= created_at`.
Both timestamps use canonical UTC RFC3339Nano with terminal `Z`, no redundant
fractional zeros or timezone offset, and a representable year from 0001 through
9999, including the exact zero-instant `0001-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Encoding
normalizes UTC and rejects out-of-range years; decoding rejects
other timestamp spellings. The digest field is only a claim until migration
compares it with a locked source record and durably replaces that record.
The future v2 confirmation transition must check the complete expected
`prepared` state/revision pair before incrementing: fresh revision 1 becomes
`confirmed` revision 2, and migrated revision 2 becomes `confirmed` revision
3. The fresh branch has null `legacy_v1_record_sha256`; the migrated branch
retains the non-null digest validated during migration. After acquiring active,
the apply coordinator must validate the complete confirmed
state/revision/provenance combination before `confirmed -> in_flight`. A
mismatch grants no permit or send and leaves the acquired active unclosed and
quarantined pending a separately reviewed recovery path, with zero mutation
bytes. A future CAS must check its expected
state/revision pair before a checked revision increment; an impossible stored
v2 pair or revision overflow is corrupt state and fails closed, never wraps or
grants authority. This does not define permit or closed journal-revision sets,
which remain deferred until the full v2
transition matrix is frozen. No confirmation or dispatch is enabled by this
contract.

Existing plan, receipt, outcome, and evidence values retain their bounded
codecs. `authority_evidence` is null only for `prepared` and v2
`canceled`/`expired` records reached before authority
acquisition; otherwise it is exactly one closed branch. `production`,
`post_grant_verification`, and `activation_smoke` retain their existing
descriptor/provisional/stage-token-or-grant/context/registry evidence. The Gate
branch is discriminated by its exact object type: Gate 1A uses
`gate_authority_evidence_v1` from the artifact protocol; Gate 1B uses
`gate1b_isolated_authority_evidence_v1` and its additional unit/host/target
bindings from the isolated-subrun ADR. Each retains exact descriptor and its
applicable root-signed token,
Gate receipt-context, and complete genesis-to-current registry-chain bytes plus
every digest needed to reconstruct the receipt verification key. It contains
no provisional authorization, smoke token, activation grant, final-production
context, or production authority. A lone final registry record or unchecked
retained SPKI cannot satisfy this branch.

`coordinator_evidence` is null before acquisition or one compact canonical
object with fields `schema_version` integer `1`, `lease_id`,
`active_bytes_base64url`, `active_sha256`, `permit_bytes_base64url`,
`permit_sha256`, `normal_closed_bytes_base64url`, `normal_closed_sha256`, and
`last_fenced_at`, in that order. Byte fields
are unpadded base64url of exact secret-free canonical coordinator objects.
Permit fields are both null before permit; normal-closed fields are both null
until the normal terminal CAS. `last_fenced_at` is null before the original
owner has irreversibly quiesced all capabilities; it is then the UTC whole-
second timestamp of that completed quiescence, never a restart or new actor's
claim of ownership. The normal terminal CAS writes that timestamp, outcome,
and exact normal closed bytes in one fsync/rename transaction. The owner alone
may add those bytes to Keychain once. A journal's closed candidate without an
actual matching durable Keychain close cannot authorize cleanup. There are no
recovery-close or recovery-actor fields and no recovery journal CAS. A later
cleanup only validates existing durable normal closure and deletes that exact
active item's persistent reference; the journal is unchanged.

Migration reads a v1 record under its existing per-plan lock using an anchored
directory file descriptor and fd-relative no-follow, nonblocking open. It
checks the real directory is owned by the effective user at mode `0700`, or
`2700` when the setgid bit is inherited from a private parent, and
the source is an owned, regular, single-link `0600` file with bounded size and
stable file identity before and after reading. Canonical decoding and exact
embedded plan ID are required. Windows migration refuses before directory or
lock creation because the same file-identity contract is not implemented
there. Only `prepared` with
`mutation_attempts == 0`, no receipt, no outcome, and no evidence may migrate:
that is the sole safe state actually producible by the currently shipped
fail-closed command path. It copies the plan, sets receipt, authority,
coordinator, outcome, and evidence null, sets
`legacy_v1_record_sha256` to SHA-256 of the exact v1 bytes, increments revision
once, and preserves state/timestamps except for `updated_at`. The internal API
requires expected revision 1; an exact already-migrated revision-2 record with
a non-null legacy digest is an idempotent read-only success for a repeated
revision-1 request only after directory fsync and exact secure reread. A
failed sync or reread remains a nonretryable commit-uncertain result; observing
the v2 bytes alone cannot launder a failed earlier directory sync into
success. It writes a same-directory exclusive `0600` temporary
file, fsyncs it, atomically renames over the v1 path, fsyncs the directory,
then securely rereads and byte-compares v2 before returning success. Any
failure before rename leaves v1 intact; failure after an uncertain rename
requires exact reread and never a second write. A post-rename directory-sync
failure remains a commit-uncertain error even when the new bytes are visible.
Before rename, an anchored reread must confirm that the source has the same
device, inode, size, modification time, and exact bytes classified under the
plan lock. Cooperating Store writers serialize on that advisory lock. POSIX
rename does not provide a conditional destination-inode comparison, so an
uncooperative process running as the same user can still race between this
last check and rename; the supported same-user trust boundary treats such
interference as denial of service, never as approval authority.

A valid v1 record that cannot safely migrate is always rejected with
`JOURNAL_V1_AUTHORITY_STATE_QUARANTINED`, including `canceled`, `expired`,
`confirmed`, `in_flight`, every valid `failed_before_mutation` record, and
`applied`, `ambiguous`, `reconciled`, `operator_resolution_required`,
`resolved_applied`, or `resolved_not_applied`, as well as a pristine
`prepared` record with v2-unrepresentable time or encoding. In particular, the v1 schema
requires `failed_before_mutation` to retain a receipt, one mutation attempt,
and a matching outcome; it is not a zero-attempt local terminal and never
migrates. The source record remains byte-for-byte unchanged. Under the plan
lock the internal Store attempts to write a separate exclusive `0600` sibling
at exact filename
`<plan-id>.v1-quarantine.json` using an exclusive same-directory `0600`
temporary file, file fsync, fd-relative `linkat` to the final marker name
without clobbering an existing marker, temporary-link removal, directory
fsync, and secure exact reread. A matching preexisting marker is preserved,
including its original detection time. The marker contains only
`schema_version`, `record_sha256`, `state`, `reason` exactly
`unsafe_v1_migration_state`, and `detected_at`; if marker creation is ambiguous
or fails, the in-memory quarantine still blocks all operations. Status may
report its digest, but neither authority recovery nor another migration can
consume it. The current `approval.Unsupported` boundary means no legitimate
current supported command path could have created any valid v1 state beyond
`prepared`; every unexpected non-prepared record remains evidence, never
authority or a migration candidate.

The quarantine marker uses the same two-space indented JSON and one terminal
LF, with all five fields present in the order above. It is capped at 1,024
bytes before decoding. `schema_version` is integer 1, `record_sha256` is the
lowercase 64-character hex digest of the exact valid v1 bytes. `state` is
`prepared` only for a valid but nonmigratable record, or one of the other
valid unsafe v1 states above. `detected_at` is canonical UTC
RFC3339Nano with terminal `Z` and year 0001 through 9999. The marker is audit
evidence only; its digest and state do not independently validate the source
record or confer authority.

## Executor boundary

The proposed REST executor has a disclosed project-move TOCTOU interval between policy
validation and mutation. A strict project-bound profile requires a custom
YouTrack MCP executor that validates and consumes the external receipt, checks
the current project and nonce, and mutates within one server transaction.
