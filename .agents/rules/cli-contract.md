# Machine contract

The command surface is this project's public API. Its consumers are AI agents
that cannot notice a silent change, so treat every item here as breaking unless
it is purely additive.

**Precedence:** this file is the specification. `internal/errx` is the
implementation of record, and `docs/contract.md` plus
`assets/skills/youtrack-agent/reference/contract.md` are generated from `internal/errx`
by `go generate`. When the generated output disagrees with this file, this file
wins and `internal/errx` is the thing that gets fixed.

## Envelope

```json
{"ok":true,"v":1,"data":{},"meta":{"count":3,"truncated":false,"next_cursor":"opaque"}}
{"ok":false,"v":1,"error":{"code":"PROFILE_REQUIRED","message":""},"hint":"pass --profile"}
```

- `ok`, `v`, `data`, `meta`, `error.code`, `error.message`, `hint` keep their
  names, types, and nullability.
- Adding a field is additive. Renaming, removing, or changing the type of one
  requires bumping `v`.
- **`v` describes the shape of the envelope, and it must be true of the binary
  that printed it.** What froze at `v0.1.0` is the shape, not the counter: from
  that tag on the shape is published, so any change to it bumps `v` in the same
  commit. A `0.x` series buys freedom in the flags and the command surface,
  never in the truthfulness of `v`.
- `v` and the binary's version are independent counters, coupled in one
  direction only. A `v` bump is a breaking change to published output, so it
  takes the largest bump the series allows — minor while `0.x`, major from
  `1.0.0`. The reverse does not hold: renaming a flag breaks the command
  contract and leaves `v` untouched.
- The envelope key set is pinned by `TestEnvelopeKeySetIsPinned` in
  `internal/output`. It fails on any rename, removal, or addition, so an
  envelope change cannot happen by accident: editing that list is the moment to
  decide about `v`.
- `error.code` is a stable `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` string. It is where new
  granularity goes — prefer a new code over a new exit code.
- `hint` is written for a machine reader: it states the next action
  (`pass --profile work`), not an apology.

## Ordered consumer parsing

Machine consumers capture stdout and stderr separately under fixed byte limits
and apply this order:

1. Stdout is valid only as exactly one complete top-level JSON object, followed
   only by whitespace, with a boolean `ok` and a JSON integer `v` whose value is
   exactly `1`. Decimal, exponent, string, null, boolean, or any other version
   representation is unsupported. Empty output, parse failure, premature EOF,
   multiple values, or a missing or wrongly typed required member is invalid.
   The remaining v1 shape is selected by `ok`:

   - `ok: true` requires present, non-null `data`; `error` and `hint` must be
     absent.
   - `ok: false` requires a present, non-null `error` object with string `code`
     and `message`, plus a present string `hint`; `data` must be absent.

   A forbidden member makes the envelope invalid even when its value is null.
   On either branch, `meta` may be absent. When present it must be a non-null
   object and may be empty. Every present known metadata member is non-null and
   has its exact v1 type: `count` is a nonnegative JSON integer written without
   a fraction or exponent, `truncated` is boolean, and `next_cursor`, `profile`,
   `instance`, `account_id`, and `account_login` are strings. A present null,
   number, boolean, array, or object is invalid for any of those string fields.
   Unknown additive metadata members are tolerated.
   They never repair a missing, null, wrongly typed, forbidden, or conflicting
   known member. Malformed `meta` makes the entire stdout envelope invalid.
2. A valid v1 stdout envelope is authoritative; stderr is ignored. This
   includes a valid `WRITE_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`, which remains unknown and must be
   reconciled, never retried automatically.
3. Every malformed or unsupported envelope makes stdout invalid. Stderr remains
   diagnostic and cannot establish whether a mutation applied.
4. A confirmed `mutation apply` with invalid stdout or
   `WRITE_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` is reconciled by bounded reads for the same receipt.
   It is never replayed automatically and inconclusive evidence becomes
   `operator_resolution_required`.

## Exit codes

Each code maps to a **distinct recovery action**. That is the test for whether a
new one is justified; if the caller's next move is the same, it is a new
`error.code`, not a new exit code.

| Code | Meaning | Caller's next move |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | ok | proceed |
| 1 | internal failure | report, do not retry |
| 2 | usage / validation | fix flags |
| 3 | not found | check the name; `did_you_mean` is in the envelope |
| 4 | ambiguous | pick from `candidates` |
| 5 | auth | re-authenticate |
| 6 | retryable (rate limit, network) | back off, retry |
| 7 | confirmation required | obtain a trusted human approval receipt |
| 8 | permission / scope denied | stop and request permission or scope |
| 9 | conflict / stale state | re-read the YouTrack object before retrying |

Two hazards that are easy to reintroduce:

- **A compiled Go binary exits `2` when it panics.** `main` must install a
  `recover()` that maps panics to `1`. Never assign a semantic meaning to `2`
  that would make a crash look like a retryable result.
- **Cobra returns a bare `1` on flag-parse errors** unless the root command sets
  `SilenceUsage` and a `SetFlagErrorFunc` that routes through `errx`.

## Flags

- Names, shorthands, and defaults are contract. A rename ships with a hidden
  alias for the old spelling.
- Every network command requires `--profile NAME`; no command switches an
  active profile and no stored default exists.
- Output is `-o/--output {text,json,raw}` plus `--fields`. `--json` is a
  retained hidden alias.
- **Output defaults to `json` when stdout is not a TTY.** Do not make an agent
  remember a flag to get parseable output.
- `mutation prepare --offline` performs no network, browser, OAuth, or
  secret-store access. `mutation confirm` has no noninteractive bypass.
- `mutation apply` requires a valid receipt and accepts no `--yes` substitute.

## Output economy

Context is the scarce resource. Default output is one compact line per entity
with a minimal field set. A command that dumps unfiltered API responses is a bug.

`-o raw` prints the payload without the envelope and without projection. It is
**not** a passthrough of YouTrack's response: the client decodes into its own
types first, so a field the tool does not model never reaches the renderer.
Documenting it as a passthrough would send a caller looking for a field that
cannot appear. A real passthrough would require the client to retain the
response bytes; that is a deliberate non-goal, not an oversight.

Invocation identity (`profile`, `instance`, `account_id`, `account_login`) is
part of JSON v1 `meta`. It must not add a header row to text output or wrap raw
output; those formats retain their one-line-per-entity and payload-only shapes.
