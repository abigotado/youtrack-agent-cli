# Security

Report vulnerabilities through the repository's private security-advisory
channel. Do not include live tokens, OAuth codes/verifiers, receipts, or private
issue content in a report.

The primary boundaries are:

- one explicit profile per remote operation, binding instance, account, OAuth
  topology, credential generation, executor, and exact project allowlist;
- OS secret-store credentials that never enter argv, environment, JSON, logs,
  receipts, profiles, or repository files;
- fixed-origin requests with redirects disabled and bounded response bodies;
- a six-tool Remote MCP read allowlist plus host enforcement or a read-only
  YouTrack identity;
- inert handling of all YouTrack-provided content;
- network-free mutation planning, trusted user-presence approval, receipt
  binding, one mutation attempt, and bounded reconciliation.

The documented Remote MCP tool catalog is internally inconsistent: it calls
predefined tools read-only while listing `create_issue`, `update_issue`,
`add_issue_comment`, `manage_issue_tags`, `link_issues`, `create_article`,
`update_article`, and `log_work`. Never treat an unfiltered `/mcp` endpoint as
read-only.

Tests must use fake credentials and local servers. They must never call a live
YouTrack instance or the real OS secret store. If a mutation response becomes
ambiguous, do not replay it; reconcile by receipt and require operator resolution
when evidence is inconclusive.
