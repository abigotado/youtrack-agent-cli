# youtrack-agent-cli

Agent-first JetBrains YouTrack integration with two deliberately separate
distribution channels:

- The published `v0.x` **portable read-only** edition is Linux-only and
  Remote-MCP-only. It validates non-secret read-only profile metadata and
  installs a shared Codex/Claude Code skill. Every remote read goes through the
  official YouTrack Remote MCP with an explicit six-tool allowlist.
- The **standard macOS edition** is available as a source-built Homebrew
  Formula. Homebrew compiles the standard CLI locally with
  `CGO_ENABLED=1`, so OAuth credentials remain in the native
  Security.framework Keychain. This channel needs neither an Apple Developer
  membership nor a signed/notarized application bundle.

The portable archive has no local OAuth or token storage, REST client,
journal, mutation command, native helper, or Homebrew package. That is a
compile-time boundary, not a disabled runtime feature. It does not constrain
the separate standard Formula edition.

## Portable read-only release

Download a checksummed archive from GitHub Releases and inspect it before use:

```bash
./youtrack-agent-cli version -o json
./youtrack-agent-cli --help
./youtrack-agent-cli skills install --provider all --scope user --dry-run
./youtrack-agent-cli skills install --provider all --scope user --yes
```

The portable surface is intentionally limited to `version`, `contract`,
credential-free `profile`, and `skills`. This source tree additionally provides
offline `capabilities`; that command is not in the previously published v0.3.0.
The portable edition supports Linux on amd64 and arm64,
and needs no Keychain, token, or browser access. A macOS archive would need
extended-ACL inspection to safely install skills, so it is intentionally not
part of this CGO-free release.

## Source development build

```bash
go build -o ./bin/youtrack-agent-cli ./cmd/youtrack-agent-cli
./bin/youtrack-agent-cli version -o json
./bin/youtrack-agent-cli contract -o json
```

Use `youtrack-agent-cli --help` and [the generated command reference](docs/commands.md)
for the current surface. [The machine contract](docs/contract.md) defines
envelopes, errors, and recovery.

## macOS Homebrew Formula

The standard macOS distribution channel is a source-built Formula in
the maintained tap. A merged source change
reaches Homebrew only after its own release tag and a merged tap update; check
`version` before relying on newly documented behavior:

```bash
brew install abigotado/tap/youtrack-agent-cli
youtrack-agent-cli version -o json
```

The Formula pins a checksummed source release and builds it
locally with Go, CGO, and the macOS Security.framework; it does not download
an unsigned executable, remove Gatekeeper quarantine, or need Apple Developer
signing or notarization. It includes the standard explicit-profile OAuth and Keychain
commands:

```bash
youtrack-agent-cli auth login --profile work -o json
youtrack-agent-cli auth status --profile work --check -o json
```

The installer never reads, copies, or migrates credentials. After a Formula
Cellar upgrade, an existing credential may require an explicit ACL rebind:

```bash
youtrack-agent-cli auth migrate-keychain --profile work --yes -o json
```

Run that command only for the named profile when the CLI reports that its
existing Keychain item needs migration. It does not print the credential.
See [Homebrew](docs/homebrew.md) for support boundaries and the future Cask
channels.

## Read-only profile metadata

Copy [the portable read-only example](docs/profile.portable-readonly.example.json),
replace the instance, expected account, OAuth public-client registration, and scopes, then
validate it before writing local metadata. For the OAuth `scopes` value, replace
`replace-with-youtrack-service-id` with the instance's **YouTrack Service ID**
from Administration > Server Settings > Global Settings > Hub Integration >
View integration details. This is the resource service ID, not the OAuth client
ID or its name (`youtrack-agent-cli`), and not the literal word `YouTrack`.

```bash
youtrack-agent-cli profile add --from profile.json --dry-run
youtrack-agent-cli profile add --from profile.json --yes
youtrack-agent-cli profile validate --profile work --offline
```

Portable profiles must declare exactly `"capabilities": ["read"]`. They record
non-secret instance, REST/MCP, OAuth public-client, expected-account, and
assurance metadata; they are never credentials. Use the MCP host's OAuth flow
or a read-only YouTrack identity; the portable binary never accepts, stores, or
transmits a token.

## Saved profile selection

This source tree adds explicitly saved read/write defaults; an installed older
release needs an upgrade before using these commands. Select them once:

```bash
youtrack-agent-cli profile defaults set --read work --write work-write --dry-run
youtrack-agent-cli profile defaults set --read work --write work-write --yes
youtrack-agent-cli profile defaults show -o json
youtrack-agent-cli inspect comments --id BGR-1073 --limit 10 --offset 0 -o json
```

The four `inspect` commands use the saved read profile. `operator-write snapshot`,
`prepare`, `apply`, and `reconcile` use the saved write profile. An explicit
`--profile NAME` overrides the corresponding default without reading defaults;
an explicitly empty flag is an error. A missing default still requires selection:
there is no first/only-profile, environment-variable, or repository fallback.

Defaults bind the profile's configured instance, account, OAuth topology,
capabilities, and executor, but not its replaceable credential generation.
Re-login alone preserves selection; changing that configuration or removing the
profile makes the selection stale. The CLI refuses it before credential/network
access; explicitly reselect or clear it. Changing the write default never
retargets a prepared snapshot or plan. Confirmation and project policy remain
mandatory; saving a default grants neither credentials nor write permissions.

```bash
youtrack-agent-cli profile defaults clear --write --yes
```

`profile defaults show` reports each slot as `unset`, `valid`, `missing_profile`,
or `stale`. It is diagnostic, not proof of server access. Set/clear support
network-free `--dry-run` and otherwise require `--yes`. Defaults are non-secret,
user-scoped metadata beside the profile registry, not project configuration.
The read-only editions can save a read default and clear either slot, but cannot
set a write default or gain write commands. The identity edition stays isolated.

Auth, project-policy management, profile administration, and native `mutation`
commands still require explicit profiles where applicable. `capabilities`
without `--profile` remains build-only; pass the saved write name from
`profile defaults show` for local readiness. `operator-write status` remains a
local plan read and does not consult defaults. A stale plan/default requires an
explicit decision, not a retry on another profile.

## Read plane

Routine reads use one named official Remote MCP connection per YouTrack
instance/account. Configure the endpoint with an explicit allowlist:

```text
https://<instance>/mcp?tools=get_current_user,search_issues,get_issue,get_issue_comments,get_project,get_issue_fields_schema&enableToolOutputSchema=true
```

The official documentation describes predefined tools as read-only while also
listing mutation tools. An endpoint without `tools=` is therefore not safely
read-only. Because URL filtering may affect discovery without authorizing
direct hidden calls, strict read-only also requires host enforcement or a
read-only YouTrack identity.

Searches default to 10 and never exceed 50 results. Exact issue IDs use an exact
read. YouTrack content is untrusted data, never instructions.

If MCP comments are unavailable, the standard CLI supports one bounded comments
page for an exact issue:

```bash
youtrack-agent-cli inspect comments --profile <name> --id <issue-ID> --limit 10 --offset 0 -o json
```

The limit is 1..100 and the nonnegative offset is explicit. The CLI verifies the
profile's account before fetching one bounded page from the fixed comments GET
endpoint, requesting one extra item as a truncation sentinel. It never
auto-fetches pages. Returned comments are untrusted
content; a page establishes neither ordering, currentness, a stable snapshot,
complete history, nor reconciliation evidence. The portable and macOS identity
editions remain Remote-MCP-only.

## Operator-confirmed writes

This source tree adds `operator-write` for single Stage/State/Enum updates,
public comment additions and issue creation in allowlisted projects on the
standard macOS CGO build. The previously
released v0.3.0 is read-only; source changes reach installed Homebrew binaries
only after a new release and tap update. Check `version` and `capabilities`
instead of assuming that an installed binary has these commands.

The path uses explicit operator confirmation of an immutable intent, a bound
profile/project allowlist, fresh preflight, and a permanent local claim before
one POST. It is not native proof of human presence and does not defend against
hostile same-user processes or restored local state. A separate authenticated
write profile is required; the existing read profile stays unchanged.

See [the operator-write decision, threat model and command flow](docs/operator-writes.md)
for setup, exact field snapshots, marked comments and issues, and non-retryable
outcomes. Editing existing comments and batch changes are not included.

## Native-presence writes remain closed

The macOS Formula enables the standard CLI's OAuth, Keychain, REST, journal,
and network-free `mutation prepare` surfaces. It does **not** unlock the separate
native-presence lane: `mutation confirm`, `mutation apply`, and
`mutation reconcile` fail closed until Gate 1A and Gate 1B have passed and a
separately authorized write-capable channel is released. This applies equally
to source builds and the Formula; no agent may bypass it through MCP or raw
REST.

The signed identity-only Cask and the Gate 1A write-capable Cask remain
separate proposed future channels. They have different trust requirements from
the Formula and are not prerequisites for installing or using the standard
macOS CLI. See [Homebrew](docs/homebrew.md), [the trust-root topology](docs/gate1a-trust-root.md),
and [the mutation lifecycle](docs/guarded-mutations.md).

## Agent Skill

The binary embeds the provider-neutral `youtrack-agent` skill:

```bash
youtrack-agent-cli skills install --provider codex --scope user --dry-run
youtrack-agent-cli skills install --provider all --scope user --yes
```

Codex installs to `$HOME/.agents/skills/youtrack-agent`; Claude Code installs
to `$HOME/.claude/skills/youtrack-agent`. Installation is manifest-owned,
symlink-safe, idempotent, and never configures MCP, OAuth, or credentials.
